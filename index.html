    Function getComputerChoice
        Random # between 1 and 3 converted to Rock, Paper, Scisssors
        Keep all the returns lower-case so playRound is easier
    Function getPlayerChoice
        Prompt entered to get rock, paper, scissors from player
        Keep all the returns lower-case so playRound is easier
    function playRound(playerSelection,computerSelection)
        9 different variations
            3 will be draws, 3 will be human wins (define those), and 3 will be computer wins (everything else)
            Under each one have a way to notate who won
                score
                human
                computer
    function game
        Keeps track of score and then after 5 games reports who wins between computer and human





    playerSelection = getPlayerChoice
    computerSelection = getComputerChoice

<!-- PSEUDOCODE

FUNCTION to decide computer's choice
    getComputerChoice will randomly return either Rock, Paper, or Scissors
    Three Choices
        Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) 
        Returns a random integer from 0 to 2
        Sike that didn't work and looked up how to do randomnumber ina  set range
        Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) is just multiplying a random decimal between 0 and 1 by 3.
    The real way to 3 random #s
        Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
        Set variables min and max. Make const because never changing.
        Set Rock to 1, Paper to 2, and Scissors to 3

FUNCTION plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors
    Two inputs, player selection and computer selection
        function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
    Thought Process
        computerSelection = getComputerChoice()
            This will be "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" instead of 1,2, or 3
        How many different variations are there? 9 variations
            Rock Rock, Paper Rock, Scissors Rock, Paper Rock, 
            Paper Paper, Paper Scissors, Scissors Rock, Scissors Paper, 
            Scissors Scissors
        function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
            case (playerSelection = "rock") && (computerSelection = "Rock"):
            return "Tie! Play again";
            break;

            case (playerSelection = "rock") && (computerSelection = "Paper"):
            return "You lose! Paper beats Rock";
            break;
        }
