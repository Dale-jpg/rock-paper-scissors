We’re going to make an implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this detailed step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘Live Preview’ links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!


1. Start a new Git repo for your project.

2. Create a blank HTML document with a script tag (Hint: it is best practice to link an external .js file). This game is going to be played completely from the console, so don’t worry about putting anything else in there.

3. Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!

4. Write the logic to get the human choice
Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user choice and returns it.

Create a new function named getHumanChoice.
Write the code so that getHumanChoice will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.
Hint: Use the prompt method to get the user’s input.
You do not need to handle reprompting if the user enters an invalid input, as that would require things we will teach later. For now, just assume the user will always enter a valid choice.
Test what your function returns by using console.log.
    

5. Declare the players score variables
Your game will keep track of the players score. You will write variables to keep track of the players score.

Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in the global scope.
Initialize those variables with the value of 0.

6. Write the logic to play a single round
Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.

Create a new function named playRound.
Define two parameters for playRound: humanChoice and computerChoice. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.
Make your function’s humanChoice parameter case-insensitive so that players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
Increment the humanScore or computerScore variable based on the round winner.

7. Write the logic to play the entire game
Your game will play 5 rounds. You will write a function named playGame that calls playRound to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.

Create a new function named playGame.
Move your playRound function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new playGame function
Play 5 rounds by calling playRound 5 times.
Hint: When you assign a function call to a variable, the return value of that function is assigned to the variable. Accessing the variable afterward will only provide the assigned value; it doesn’t recall the function. You need to recall the choice functions to get new choices for each round.
Re-work your previous functions or create more helper functions if necessary. Specifically, you may want to change the return values to something more useful.
If you already know about loops, you can use them. If not, don’t worry! Loops will be covered in the next lesson.
